Dependencies
------------

| Note: we have specific instructions for the following operating
  systems:

-  CentOS / RHEL (and dependent distributions): `version 8 <#cc8>`__
   (i.e. CentOS 8, RHEL 8), `version 7 <#cc7>`__ (i.e. CentOS 7, RHEL
   7).
-  `Ubuntu <#ubuntu>`__
-  `MS Windows <#windows>`__

For remaining systems (other distros of Linux, other Unix, embedded Linux: PetaLinux, Yocto)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Mandatory:

C++ compiler with C++11 support (gcc 4.8x or newer is just fine)

| OPCUA protocol stacks / toolkits (either of them is needed):

-  *(paid product)* The Unified Automation OPC UA C++ server toolkit in
   versions 1.5.x, 1.6.x, 1.7.x
-  *(free and open-source)*
   `open62541-compat <https://github.com/quasar-team/open62541-compat/>`__
   (made by quasar team). `More info on alternative
   backends <converted/AlternativeBackends.html>`__.

| Boost development libraries. (In principle, boost-regex, boost-devel,
  boost-thread and boost-program-options should be sufficient).

| Python3 and some libraries (Jinja2, colorama, lxml, pygit2)

cmake3, version 3.10 + (for older versions you could try older quasar
versions)

| kdiff3 for occasional merges.

| Recommended:

-  Schema-aware XML editor for editing the design file. We use Eclipse,
   as can be seen in the screen casts. Any text editor will do but few
   of them are really convenient for editing XML files according to XSD
   schema.
-  Good C++ development environment (or IDE, ...). Eclipse CDT does just
   fine.
-  Good merge tool. We use kdiff3 (available as kdiff3 RPM in SLC6
   Linux).
-  ArtisticStyle ( http://astyle.sourceforge.net/ ) for automatic
   formatting of generated code. If you don't use it, the generated code
   will look like a shipwreck (but will still work). Astyle is easy to
   get (e.g. standard in Ubuntu) so get it.
-  graphviz, if you want to visualize your object design in UML-alike
   class diagram.
-  UnifiedAutomation UaExpert or any other OPC UA Client for exploring
   OPC UA address space.
-  Valgrind, for checking memory-related problems
-  PDF viewer for opening UML-like diagrams created from design file.
-  Doxygen for generating documentation.
-  RPM Build tools for RPM generation

Quick setup hints for CentOS 8 (the most standard way)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Install packages from CentOS 8 default repos:

   .. container:: mycode

      sudo yum install gcc-c++ gdb boost-devel boost-regex
      boost-program-options boost-signals cmake kdiff3 graphviz valgrind
      doxygen rpm-build xsd openssl-devel libxml2-devel xerces-c-devel
      python3-colorama python3-jinja2

#. Install packages from epel repo (by default enabled in CentOS 8):

   .. container:: mycode

      sudo yum install astyle

#. Note that currently quasar is compatible only with Python3 and it
   expects "python3" executable to be somehow available.
   NOTE: users stuck on Python2 can use earlier version of quasar, e.g.
   1.4.2.

| 

Quick setup hints for CC7/CentOs7 users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Get Eclipse (www.eclipse.org), preferably the C/C++ Developers
   version (e.g.
   https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/oxygenr)
   Once installed, install Eclipse add-ons for XML editors
#. Issue this to install software from the official CC7 RPM repos:

   .. container:: mycode

      sudo yum install gcc-c++ gdb boost-devel boost-regex
      boost-program-options boost-signals cmake3 kdiff3 graphviz
      valgrind doxygen rpm-build xsd openssl-devel libxml2-devel
      xerces-c-devel libgit2 libgit2-devel python36-jinja2 python36-lxml
      python36-colorama

#. Deploy Python's pygit2 (recommended)
   WARNING: the version of pygit2 should match the version of
   libgit2-devel! At the time of writing it was 0.26.4

   .. container:: mycode

      sudo pip install pygit2==0.26.4
#. If you have access to the UA SDK, install it (the evaluation version
   works fine). Quasar should work with UA SDK versions 1.3.2 up to
   1.5.5. If you don't have the UA SDK, you can run Quasar with
   open62541, through open62541-compat module which is off-the-shelf
   available in Quasar. Documentation : ...
#. Download UaExpert for an universal test&dev tool for OPC-UA.

Quick setup hints for Ubuntu 20.04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Execute:

.. container:: mycode

   sudo apt install cmake g++ libboost-all-dev libxml2-utils astyle
   xsdcxx libxerces-c-dev libssl-dev kdiff3 default-jre libxml2-utils
   python-enum34 python-lxml python3-pip

.. container:: mycode

   sudo pip3 install -U Jinja2

| 

Quick setup hints for Ubuntu 19.04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Execute:

.. container:: mycode

   sudo apt install cmake g++ libboost-all-dev libxml2-utils astyle
   xsdcxx libxerces-c-dev libssl-dev kdiff3 default-jre libxml2-utils
   python-enum34 python-lxml

| 

Quick setup hints for Ubuntu 14.04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Execute:

.. container:: mycode

   sudo apt-get install cmake g++ libboost-all-dev libxml2-utils astyle
   xsdcxx libxerces-c-dev libssl-dev kdiff3 default-jre libxml2-utils

| 
| Note you will need the UA SDK (i.e. evaluation version) or alternative
  backend (consider open62541 with quasar integration).

Setup for Windows users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tutorial
--------

| quasar has a pretty detailed tutorial for both newcomers as well as
  experienced users.
| The tutorial is available at our YouTube channel:
| https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQdLb4N-CEWrpYROcC-UF6w
| The relevant playlist:
| https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz6bxFrT1-KBZxoSxr4ZvlTyxNeYE3L7b

Optional modules
----------------

| quasar is containing a list of built-in (mandatory) modules. A number
  of optional modules exist which can be used for implementing various
  flavours of OPC UA servers. Amongst those are alternative OPC UA
  backends, APIs for device specific protocols or software utilites.
| The list of optional modules is maintained by the quasar team on
  `github <https://github.com/quasar-team/quasar-modules>`__.
| To enable and use a module:
| ./quasar.py enable_module MyQuasarModule [tag] [git server]
| Pulls quasar-modules MyQuasarModule from git, checks version of chosen
  module to be compatible. A module version can be specified, if later a
  new module tag/release is needed, call the command again (the existing
  module version will be removed). You can specify a git server URL e.g.
  to use mirrors in restricted networks (e.g.
  ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999).
| To download the module and include it in the build configuration run:
| ./quasar.py prepare_build
| cmake will check for new enabled modules and pull from git if they are
  not yet existing. Thereafter you can build your project normally using
  ./quasar.py build which will consider includes and create and link an
  object library called like the module itself.
| Further commands related to optional modules are:
| ./quasar.py remove_module MyQuasarModule Removes downloaded module
  code, if modifications are found - abort.
| ./quasar.py disable_module MyQuasarModule Removes module and disables
  its use (need to enable first again if needed).
| ./quasar.py list_modules [git server] List all maintained modules from
  git and their required quasar versions.
| ./quasar.py list_enabled_modules List all modules enabled in the
  project and their versions.

FAQ
---

| How to build an executable withdebug symbols?
| Just append Debug to your "quasar.py build" invocation, i.e.:
| ./quasar.py build Debug

| Build fails
| Try to read carefully the output.
| If you can't figure the issue on your own, try contacting
  quasar-developers@cern.ch

| The server starts up, but crashes.
| There are plenty of possibilities here. The best way is to build a
  server with debug symbols (explained above in the tutorial) and enable
  core dumping in your system. Then run it again and let it crash. You
  will obtain a coredump file, which you can load into GDB this way:
| gdb <path_to_executable> <core_dump_file>
| Then type 'bt' and gdb will show you crash back trace. If it seems
  that the crash is within quasar itself, please don't hesitate and file
  a report to us.

quasar (itself) misbehaves (not to confuse with quasar-made OPC-UA
components). What can I do?

#. You can increase verbosity of quasar tooling itself. This might point
   you to a problem (e.g. file permissions issues) or can help quasar
   developers diagnose the problem.
   The verbosity is controlled by environment variable called
   "QUASAR_LOG_LEVEL" and the most relevant levels are "INF" (the
   default, about no debug) and "DBG" (a lot of debug).
   If you use bash, you can increase the verbosity by invoking:

   .. container:: mycode

      export QUASAR_LOG_LEVEL=DBG

#. Sometimes quasar tooling (e.g. anything you run via quasar.py
   command) will terminate with error. We did pay attention to be
   verbose enough but sometimes it might help to drop in the Python
   Debugger (pdb) to debug post-mortem rather than to drop to shell.
   This can be achieved by exporting the variable QUASAR_RUN_PDB to 1,
   e.g. in bash:

   .. container:: mycode

      export QUASAR_RUN_PDB=1

#. The general support email is quasar-developers@cern.ch. You can get
   some support there or you can file a bug ticket directly via GitHub.

| How to create a RPM package with my server?
| RPM builder is provided with the quasar. RPM builder builds "directly"
  from your version control system and not from your local files (this
  is intentional and will not be changed). At the moment SVN and Git are
  supported.
| Please have a look at scripts in RPM/build_from_svn or
  RPM/build_from_git.

You will need to set repository paths in the build scripts.

| Then edit template.spec:

#. In the very first line, set name of the RPM. It shall match the value
   of "projectShortName" which you have put into design element of your
   Design.xml file.
#. You may edit Summary: field with short (one-line) description of the
   server.
#. You may edit %description section with long description of the
   server.
#. Review the list of files listed in %install section. These files will
   be packed inside the package. Add additional files, if applicable
   (e.g. documentation, data files, additional libraries, etc...)
#. If applicable, complete %pre, %post, %preun and %postun sections.

Commit changes in both files

| To generate RPM, run either:
| ./buildRpm.sh --revision <revision_number>
| or
| ./buildRpm.sh --tag <tag_name>

IMPORTANT: For delivering production packages, you should first tag
given release on SVN, and then generate RPM from the tag (using the
second version of command listed above).

How to upgrade to newer release of quasar?

#. Download quasar in the version of your choice
#. Unpack it
#. Execute quasar.py upgrade_project which is in its root directory,
   passing path to your project to be upgraded as the first parameter:
   ./quasar.py upgrade_project <path>

| What is the difference between cache variable and source variable?
| The difference lies in where factual value of the variable is stored,
  which impacts what happens after Read OPC UA Transaction:

-  For cache variables, there are stored in the server's RAM (thus
   "cache"), and the value served back to the client is the value from
   RAM. Cache variables are perfect whenever some device logic code
   updates the address space or reads from the address space.
-  For source variables, there are stored "at the source", which for
   example might be at a remote computer. Therefore every Read
   transaction will trigger Device Logic method supposed to fetch that
   data from the source.  Contrary to cache variables one may expect
   that such Read  transaction may be blocking and time consuming, and
   therefore may be required to be executed in a separate thread of
   execution.

| Here is a picture taken from our CHEP2015 poster with sequence
  diagrams for both types of variables:
| |image1|

| Can I use evaluation version of the UA Toolkit to create an OPC UA
  server using this framework?
| You can.
| Note that for many basic features you can use free and open-source
  open62541-compat backend instead of paid UA Toolkit.

| How to use upgrade_design tool?
| Rarely - but sometimes - XML stylesheet of Design file (Design.xsd)
  changes in backwards-incompatible way. For all such changes conversion
  tools are provided to mitigate the pain. upgrade_design is one of
  them.
| upgrade_design currently accepts this commands:

-  ./quasar.py upgrade_design convert_to_hasDeviceLogic=yes
-  ./quasar.py upgrade_design add_nullPolicy=nullAllowed or ./quasar.py
   upgrade_design add_nullPolicy=nullForbidden
-  ./quasar.py upgrade_design remove_makeSetGet=yes

Please refer to the Changelog which lists (in backwards incompatibility
column) at which moments you may need any of the above.

| Can I automatically prepare the required dependencies?
| We have a shell script which could be useful if you e.g. need to
  crosscompile and do not yet have the libs required by Quasar. The
  script is places in the Documentation/Addons/prepare_dependencies.sh

| How does a developer define specific command line options for my
  quasar server implementation?
| This is documented here: `User Defined Command Line
  Parameters <converted/UserDefinedCommandLineParameters.html>`__

| How does a developer define a dynamic (at start up) configuration? For
  example, where the server 'discovers' connected hardware on start up.
| This is documented here: `User Defined Runtime
  Configuration <converted/UserDefinedRuntimeConfigurationModification.html>`__

| How does a developer persist a 'discovered' configuration as described
  above? For example, where the server 'discovers' connected hardware
  initially and saves it for use thereafter as a static configuration.
| This is also documented here: `User Defined Runtime
  Configuration <converted/UserDefinedRuntimeConfigurationModification.html#persist>`__

| How do I link libraries, add include directories, use build
  configurations etc... ? See `build system
  doc <converted/quasarBuildSystem.html>`__.
